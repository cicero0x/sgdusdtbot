# sgdusdtbot

The sgdusdt bot was just a simple query bot to  find out a proxy "market rate" for usdtsgd as there was no simple sgdusdt market that is liquid in SG. Using BTCSGD prices from gemini and dividing it by BTCUSDT prices from usdt, i could get the sgdusdt price. I can then compare that price with sgdusd on the fx market, and see if it was trading at a premium or discount. 

Wasn't very actionable since the markets move quite quickly and withdrawals from exchange took quite a while. Nevertheless it did help brush up my python and api skills.
